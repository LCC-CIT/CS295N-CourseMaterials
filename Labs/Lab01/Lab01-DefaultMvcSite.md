# Lab 1

## Build the Visual Studio Default MVC Web Site

CS295N, Web Development 1: ASP.NET

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in the tutorial shown below to create an ASP.NET Core MVC web site. Instead of naming the project "MVCMovie", name it "YourNameSite", but replace YourName with your actual name.

Change the home page to say something of your own choosing.

### Submission to Moodle

This week you will not submit a beta version of your web site. You will only submit a screen-shot of the home page of your running app.

1. Take a screen-shot of the home page of your app. 

   Include the address bar of the browser in the screen-shot.

2. Upload the screen-shot to Moodle.

Completing this assignment will satisfy the "no-show / drop" requirement of completing an assignment in the first week for any students who did not participate in the live Zoom class session.
