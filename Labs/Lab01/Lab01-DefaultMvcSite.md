# Lab 1, Default  Site

CS295N, Web Development 1: ASP.NET

In this lab, you will be creating a web site that you will continue to build on in subsequent lab assignments. The type of site you make will depend on the Moodle group to which you have been assigned. These are the types of sites you will create:

- Group A: Community site&mdash;this can be a site for a neighborhood, a club, or any other type of group.
- Group B: Fan site&mdash;a site dedicated to a person, book, music group or anything else you might be a fan of.
- Group C: Informational site&mdash;this site can contain information on any topic like food, politics, cats, or anything else you are interested in.

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in the tutorial shown below to create an ASP.NET Core MVC web site. But, instead of naming the project "MVCMovie", name it "YourNameSite", but replace YourName with your actual name.

[Getting Started with ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)

Change the home page so that it has a title and a sentence or two appropriate to the type of site designated by the group you are in.

Create a private Git repository and put the web project into a branch named lab1.

### Submission

This week you will not make a beta version of your web site or do code reviews.

1. Take a screen-shot of the home page of your app. 

   Include the address bar of the browser in the screen-shot.

2. Upload the screen-shot to Moodle.

3. Enter the URL of the lab1 branch of your Git repository in the Moodle online text.

Completing this assignment will satisfy the "no-show / drop" requirement of completing an assignment in the first week for any students who did not participate in the live Zoom class session.
