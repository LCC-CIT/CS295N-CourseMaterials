# Code Review Checklist

## CS295N, Web Development 1

Refer to the [Code Review Guide](CodeReviewGuide.html) for while doing code reviews to see descriptions of correct code style and best practices.

Enter "Yes" or "No" in the square brackets. For any items with a "No", add a description of the problem. Remember that you don't need to review the entire web app, just the new code or changes made for the current lab assignment.

You can paste  the checklist below into the comments on the PR from your lab partner when doing a code review. Just paste the checklist, not these instructions. &#128516;
