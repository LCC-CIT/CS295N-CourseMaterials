# Lab 9

## Debugging

- Use your browser’s Web Console to monitor network traffic between your development server and the browser. Here are instructions for using the [Firefox Web Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console).
- Make a copy of a my web app [DebuggingPracticeGroupB](https://github.com/LCC-CIT/CS295N-CourseMaterials/tree/master/Labs/Lab05/DebuggingPractice-GroupB).

- Debug the app using all the debugging techniques you know:
  - Setting breakpoints in Visual Studio
  - Looking at the URL in the browser address bar.
  - Monitoring HTTP traffic.
  - Using “View Source” in the browser to see how your view was rendered into HTML
- Fix the app so that all the links and pages work as described on the main page of the app
