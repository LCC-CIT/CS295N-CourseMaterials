##Controllers and HTTP

###Part 1: Controller Tutorial

Either copy the code from the text into a Visual Studio project or download the example project for Freeman Ch. 17. 

#### Sections of the exercise for you to do:

- In, Creating Controllers, do <u>Using the Controlelr Base Class</u>, pp. 514--515
- In, Receiving Context Data, Getting Data from Context Objects, do <u>Using Action Method Parameters</u>, pp. 520--522
- In, Producing a Response, read Understanding Action Results, do <u>Producing an HTML Response</u>, pp. 526--527
- In Producing a Response, skim Understanding the Serarch for a View File, then read Using a View Model Object (pg. 530), do Redirect the client, pp. 528--52 (Listings 25–30)
- Return content to the client  31–35
- Return an HTTP status code 36–37
- Take screen shots at the end of each major step.

Take screen shots at the end of each major step.

**Part 2: Monitoring HTTP Traffic and Debugging**

- Either Install [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or use your browser’s Web Console to monitor network traffic between your development server and the browser. Here are instructions for using the [Firefox Web Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console).
- Make a copy of a my web app, [DebuggingPracticeGroupA](https://github.com/LCC-CIT/CS295N-CourseMaterials/tree/master/Labs/Lab05/DebuggingPractice-GroupA).  Note: this app is in my Course Materials repository. You will need to clone the whole repository to get this app. Make your own copy of the solution folder in a new location.
- Debug the app using all the debugging techniques you know:
  - Setting breakpoints in Visual Studio
  - Looking at the URL in the browser address bar
  - Monitoring HTTP traffic
  - Using “View Source” in the browser to see how your view was rendered into HTML
- Fix the app so that all the links and pages work as described on the main page of the app
