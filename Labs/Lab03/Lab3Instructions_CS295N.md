### Implementation Instructions

#### Models

- Decide what two models you will need.
- Decide the relationship between the models.

#### Controllers

You should already have an existing HTTP GET method that displays the view that will contain the data entry form.

- Write an HTTP POST method that gets the information from the form, then displays a page containing all the message, story, or post just entered.

#### Views

- Add a data entry form to the message, story, or post view. Make the view strongly typed.
- Add a view that shows one message story, or post. Make the view strongly typed.
