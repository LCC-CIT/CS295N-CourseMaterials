# Code Review Guide

## Functionality

- Does it compile without errors?
- Does it run without throwing exceptions or crashing?
- Does it meet all the requirements for this lab assignment?

## Aspects of coding style to check

- Is proper indentation used?

- Are the HTML elements and variables named descriptively?

- Have any unnecessary lines of code or files been removed?

- Are there explanatory comments in the code?

- Do variable names use camelCase? 

- Are properties, methods and classes named using PascalCase (aka TitleCase)?

- Are constant names written using ALL_CAPS?

## Best practices in Object Oriented Programming

- Is the code DRY (no duplicated blocks of code)?

- Are named constants used instead of repeated literal constants?

- Is code that does computation or logical operations separated into its own class instead of being added to the code-behind?

- Are all instance variables (aka fields) private?

- Are local variables used instead of instance variables wherever possible?

- Does each method do just one thing (no “Swiss Armey” methods)?

- Are classes “loosely coupled” and “highly coherent”?
