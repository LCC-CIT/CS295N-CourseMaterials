## Part 2: Skeletal Web Site

Add to the web site you crated in lab 1 by creating a "skeleton" (a set of empty pages) for your site. A site map is shown below for each group's web site. The site map is shown in the form of an un-ordered list. The main bullet points represent top-level web pages, and sub-point bullets represent pages linked from the top-level pages. 

These pages will all be place-holders. The only content will be a heading,  a sentence saying what the page is for, and one or more links to other pages.

### Implementation Instructions

#### Controllers

Write a controller class for each top-level page of the site. Write a method in the controller for each sub-page. Remember that the Home controller should have an index method, index methods are optional in other controllers.

#### Views

Each view can just be a place-holder for the information described above.
It should have links to any sub-pages.

#### Models

No models are needed yet. You will add those in a future lab.
