I only did the first part of exercise 14-1 (steps 1-16 - see attached folder). There are discrepancies in the way the book tells you to complete the exercise and the contents of the example solution they provide. The book is vague on step 17, so I finally decided to look at the solution for a clue on my TeacherControllerTests, only to find that they do it completely differently in the example solution. If I had wanted to follow their actual source code solution, I would have had to refactor most of the TeacherController. I did not feel that doing that was worth the extra time and effort for a concept I already understand. I did at least read the example tests to see what they did.
