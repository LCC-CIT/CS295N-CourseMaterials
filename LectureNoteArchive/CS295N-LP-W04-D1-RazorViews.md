### HTTP Sessions

The textbook refers to HTTP sessions. An [HTTP session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#HTTP_session) is something a server uses to keep track of the clients that are using it at any given time. The most common way of doing this is by causing the browser to create a cookie with a unique identifier.

### Controller

- An ASP.NET Core class that contains methods known as actions, or action methods which handle HTTP requests. A new instance of the controller class is created for each HTTP request.
- The controller object is provided with *context data* for each request.
- The type of HTTP response is designated by the return type of the action method. The most common type of response returns a Razor view.
