Introduction We've already been using Controllers, so you are already familiar with the basics. Now we will look deeper at how controllers work and how to use additional features.

##Controller Review

- Create controller classes by inheriting from the AspNetCore.Mvc.Controller class. 
  Note: you can create a controller from scratch rather than inheriting from the framework Controller class, but it takes more effort.
- By convention, the class name ends in Controller.
- Controllers process HTTP requests. Each expected request will be mapped to a controller method (aka *controller action*)

### HTTP Basics

- Requests

  - Methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD (like GET, but without a response body), DELETE, OPTIONS
  - Message ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_message))
    - A request line (e.g., *GET /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1*, which requests a resource called `/images/logo.png` from the server.)
    - One or more [request header fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_request_header_field) (e.g., *Accept-Language: en*).
    - An empty line
    - An optional [message body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_message_body)

- Response messages

  - A status line which includes the [status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) and reason message (e.g., *HTTP/1.1 200 OK*, which indicates that the client's request succeeded.)
  - One or more [response header fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_header_field) (e.g., *Content-Type: text/html*)
  - An empty line
  - An optional [message body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_message_body)
