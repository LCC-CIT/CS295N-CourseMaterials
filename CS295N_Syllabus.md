### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.

### Attendance

Attendance is not graded but will be essential for successful completion of the class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining the course content provided in class and mastering it. 

#### No-Show Drop

LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy. You must come to class at least once during the first week or be automatically dropped.

### Accessibility and Accommodations

If you need support or assistance because of a disability, you may be eligible for academic accommodations through Disability Services. For more information, contact Disability Services at 463-5150 (voice) or 463-3079 (TTY), or stop by building 1, room 218.
