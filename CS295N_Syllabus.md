# Course Resources

## Required Textbook   

*Murach’s ASP.NET Core MVC*, 1st Edition, by Mary Delamater and Joel Murach, Murach Books, 2020. ISBN 978-1-943872-49-7. You can purchase the textbook from the [Titan Store](https://www.bkstr.com/laneccstore/home) or from the publisher, [Murach Books](https://www.murach.com/shop-books/web-development-books/murach-s-asp-net-core-mvc-detail). 

[Free chapters and code](https://www.murach.com/shop-books/web-development-books/murach-s-asp-net-core-mvc-detail)

The first two chapters of the book and the source code for the sample programs and exercises in the text are also available for download on the [publisher's web site](https://www.murach.com/shop-books/web-development-books/murach-s-asp-net-core-mvc-detail), under the tab "Free Downloads".

## Required Software

The class examples and the textbook are based on using the Windows operating system for development, but you may alternatively use Mac OS or Linux. 

### Visual Studio IDE

We will be using [Visual Studio 2022, Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), which is available as a free download. You may alternatively use the Visual Studio 2022, Enterprise Edition which is available at no cost to students (see below). 

The version of the .NET framework we will be using is [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1). You will need to download the latest release of this version of the .NET framework SDK for your OS (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

### Git

You will need to use Git for version control. Git itself is a command line program which you can [download from the Git Community web site](https://git-scm.com/downloads). You can use Git from the command line , or use a Git GUI client. There is a very good [Git client built into Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/version-control/git-with-visual-studio?view=vs-2022) and you can also donwload the free [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app for working with Git.

##  Free and Discounted Software for Students

- [Azure Dev Tools for Teaching](https://signup.azure.com/studentverification?offerType=3) (previously known as Microsoft Imagine Premium) is a subscription-based offering, paid for by the LCC CIT department, providing access to professional development and design tools, software, and services from Microsoft. 

  **Note:** You need to have a [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/?refd=login.live.com) to access this page and sign up for this program. Microsoft has two kinds of accounts: *personal* and *work/school*. To sign up for this, use a <u>personal</u> account.
- [Microsoft Office 365](https://lanecc.helpjuice.com/student-faqs/microsoft-office-365-for-lcc-students-staff) LCC students and staff can get a free subscription to Office 365, which includes Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and more.
- [On The Hub](https://lanecc.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_mnuMain=f189368a-f0a6-e811-8109-000d3af41938) has partnered with Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Symantec, VMware and other software publishers to offer discounted and free software for students and faculty.
- <u>Markdown Viewers and Editors</u>: Most software development documentation is written using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). GitHub uses Markdown for almost all it's docs including readme files and PR comments. You can write and edit Markdown directly on GitHub's web pages, but you might also want a Markdown viewer and/or editor to work with Markdown offline. Here are some options:

  - [Visual Studio Markdown extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.MarkdownEditor): This is a full featured Markdown editor and viewer.
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): VS Code has [built in Markdown editing features](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown) and there are a number of Markdown add-ons available as well.
  - [Typora](https://typora.io/): Not free ($14.99), but probably the best editor I've ever used. Available for Windows, MacOS, and LInux.
  - [PanWriter](https://panwriter.com/): A free, bare-bones editor and viewer for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
  - [Markdown Viewer for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-viewer-chrome/): In addition to this, there are other markdown viewer add-ons available for Firefox as well as all other browsers.


None of the software provided in these offers is required for this class, but you may want to take advantage of the free software.

## CIT Computer Lab and in-Person Tutoring

## Weekly Learning Activities

|                      | Sunday                                     | Monday                            | Tuesday                               | Thursday                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Reading and quiz** |                                            | Take the quiz <u>before class</u> |                                       | Start reading the next chapter |
| **Last week's lab**  | Finish beta, send a PR to your lab partner |                                   | Do a code review for your lab partner | Submit production version      |


## Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.

## Attendance

Attendance is not graded but will be essential for successful completion of the class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining the course content provided in class and mastering it. For students in an online class, watching the video recordings is equivalent to attending the class sessions.

### No-Show Drop

LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy. You must come to class at least once during the first week or be automatically dropped.
