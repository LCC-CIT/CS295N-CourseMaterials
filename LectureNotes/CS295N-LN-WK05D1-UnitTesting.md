## Introduction

- Answer questions about the midterm.
- Answer questions about lab 4 and publishing to Azure.
- Describe where we're going: databases, unit testing with databases.



## Unit Testing Overview 

We'll cover more details of unit testing later, but here are some basic concepts:

- MVC facilitates unit testing - this is one of the reasons to use MVC

- What to test?

  - Business logic (in models, or in separate classes)
    - If Models just contain simple C# properties, they don't really need tests

  - Controller methods

    - This is what usually makes the most sense to test

- Test using data from a real database? No!

  - Why?
    - The database may not contain optimal data for doing certain tests. 
    - Itâ€™s not advisable to put test data into a production database
    - The data can change over time and cause tests to fail.
    - The tests could cause unwanted changes to the real data.

  - Solution - test against a "fake" repository

- xUnit

  Used by the .NET Core team to test their own code.

  Test runner integrated in Visual Studio

  Note: Assert.Equal method uses the Equal method of .NET objects for comparison. Primitive .NET types and many classes in the .NET library have fully implemented this method. You only need to write a Compare class (as shown in the textbook) if you are using a class that doesn't already have a comparator implemented for the Equals method.



## Test Driven Development

- Test first. Writing unit tests before writing the methods they test gives you a clear idea of what the method should do and speeds up development by letting you test easily and often.
- Test after bug fixes.
- Test after adding new features.
- Regression testing.



## Wrap-up

- Look at the lab assignment
- Look at the term project requirements
- Look at due dates on Moodle
