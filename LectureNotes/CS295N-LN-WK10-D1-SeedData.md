## Announcements  

**For 11/22/23**


- Upcoming due dates:

  - Term project  
    The dates for the beta version and code review are flexible, but make arrangements with your lab partners if you want to change these dates.

    - Send a PR for the beta version: Tuesday, 11/28

    - Submit a link to a code review on a PR: Thursday, 11/30 

    - Presentation to the class: Monday, 12/4

    - Submit links to the production version: Monday, 12/4

  - Labs

    - Lab 7 Production version: pushed out to Thursday, 11/30  
      But, if you have it working this week, submit it.

    - Lab 8 Code review: Tuesday, 11/28

    - Lab 8 Production version: 11/30

    - Lab 9 is optional, extra credit: 12/4

  - Final Quiz: online Monday 12/4 through Wednesday 12/6  
    If anyone wants to take the quiz on campus, in the classroom, I'll open the classroom on Wednesday.

- Discuss questions.  

  - .NET 6 example.
  - MySQL on Azure.

  - Duplicate entities in databases.  
    After covering seed data, I will talk about how to avoid creating duplicate entities, for example Books. We won't address duplicate entities for the same user this term. That will be taken care of by Identity next term.



## Introduction

Seed data is data that is automatically added to your database when the application is started. There are two main purposes for seed data:

- Development testing.
- Data that is needed in production. For example, data that will populate pre-defined select lists.

## Seeding Your Database

One way to seed your database is to write a class with a static method that will add entities to the database. The method to seed the database will be called from *Startup*. I put mine in a static class named *SeedData*, but it's not a special name (not part of a convention).

Note that the method I'm using here is different from the method shown in the textbook (Murach and Delameter, Ch. 4, pg 142, 2022).

### Seed Data class and method

````c#
public class SeedData
{
   public static void Seed(AppDbContext context)
   {
      if (!context.Reviews.Any())  // this is to prevent adding duplicate data
      {
        	// Create User objects
        	User reviewer1 = new User { Name = "Emma Watson" };
        	User reviewer2 = new User { Name = "Brian Bird" };
        	// Queue up user objects to be saved to the DB
          context.Reviews.Add(user1);  
        	context.Reviews.Add(user1);
        	context.SaveChantes();  // Saving adds UserId to User objects
        
          Review review = new Review
          {
              BookTitle = "Prince of Foxes",
              AuthorName = "Samuel Shellabarger",
              ReviewText = "Great book, a must read!",
              Reviewer = reviewer1,
              ReviewDate = DateTime.Parse("11/1/2020")
          };
          context.Reviews.Add(review);  // queues up a review to be added to the DB

          review = new Review
          {
              BookTitle = "Virgil Wander",
              AuthorName = "Lief Enger",
              ReviewText = "Wonderful book, written by a distant cousin of mine.",
              Reviewer = reviewer2,
              ReviewDate = DateTime.Parse("11/30/2020")
          };
          context.Reviews.Add(review);  

          context.SaveChanges(); // stores all the reviews in the DB
       }
    }
  }
}
````

### Call the Seed method from Program.cs

- Add code at the end of the file, just before `app.Run();`

- Get an instance of your class that is derived from `DbContext`  
  ```c#
  // Get a DbContext object -- we will refactor this
  var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
  var context = scope.ServiceProvider
                     .GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();
  ```

- Call the Seed method and pass it your DbContext object  
  ```c#
  SeedData.Seed(context);
  ```

- Refactor this to use a  [`using` statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/using) (this is not the same as the using statement for namespaces).
  ```c#
  using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
  {
      var dbContext = scope.ServiceProvider
                           .GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();
      SeedData.Seed(dbContext);
  }
  ```

The `Seed` method will get called when you run your web app.
