## Overview

**Microsoft Azure** is a [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) service created by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed [data centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center). It provides [software as a service (SaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service), [platform as a service (PaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) and [infrastructure as a service (IaaS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service) and supports many different [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure)

 

## Azure for Students

Microsoft offers a free Azure subscription for students and gives you $100 in credit on to spend on Azure services. The subscription is good for 12 moths or until you use up your credit—whichever comes first. There are many [services that are free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) with this subscription. We will not use Azure for anything that requires you to use your Azure credit in this class, so you should be able to use your account for the full 12 months. If you are still a student when the 12 months end, you can renew your free subscription.
