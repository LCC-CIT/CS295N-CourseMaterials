## Overview of MVC

- MVC

  - Not new, originated in 1978 with the Smalltalk project at Xerox PARC
  - Became popular with Ruby on Rails, 2005
  - Block diagram (arrows show direction of dependencies):
                 M
                ^  ^
               /    \
               V <â€” C 

  - Model: data
  - View: renders HTTP responses
  - Controller: responds to HTTP request

- Facilitates programming best practices

  - Minimize dependencies
  - Separation of concerns

  - Unit tests

- MVC Embraces the statelessness of HTTP

  - No false state implementation
  - No complicated page lifecycle (handling click events)
  - View gives you full control of HTML

## Demo

- Build the default VS web site
  - Identify the Models, Views, and Controllers
  - Identify dependencies
  - Identify HTML, CSS, and JS resource

## Class Procedures

- Discuss code reviews
- Discuss weekly cycle of assignments 
- Review due dates
