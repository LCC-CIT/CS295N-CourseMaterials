## Introduction

You've already been debugging using these techniques:

- Running in debug mode in Visual Studio:
  - Setting breakpoints in Visual Studio to:
    - discover flow of execution
    -  examine the values of variables by hovering and using local and watch windows.
    - Try out code using the immediate window.
  - Stopping on exceptions and viewing the Exception Helper. This happens automatically.
- Internal Server Error page. (This is not the same as the Error page in the shared view folder.)
- Unit tests:
  - Run existing unit tests.
  - Add unit tests for suspicous methods.
- Eliminating suspicous code:
  - Temporarily comment out code that you think might be causing a run-time error.
  - Disable or replace method calls to code you think might be causing a run-time error.
- Looking at URLs in the browser to see which controller methods a link or redirect are going to.
- View the source code in the browser to see how ASP.NET has rendered a razor view.
- Check for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript errors in the browser console.
- Checking the database schema and data using:
  -  MySQL Workbench for MySQL databases.
  - Server Explorer in Visual Studio for SQL Server.
- Swapping connection strings to try to narrow down the source of database problems.
- Looking at log files on Azure.

Overall concept of troubleshooting: "Divide and conquor", meaning use a systematic process of elimination to narrow down the possible causes of failure until you've found the problem.

## Additional Debugging Techniques

These are things we haven't talked talked about yet.

- Viewing network traffic in the browser's developer tools.
- Visual Studio tracepoints.
- Error logging and the Error page added by Visual Studio.
- Setting development mode on Azure
  - Change the environment variable.
  - Requires changing the connection string in appsettings.development.json for the deployed site.
