# Suggestions for Next Year's Class (2023)

[TOC]

## Update to .NET 6

This is so that students can use many-to-many relationships for things like tags.

[Migrate for ASP.NET Core 5.0 to 60](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/50-to-60?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio)

## Ideas for web dev lab projects

- Ride share service (like uber)
- Psychology web site with personality survey? (maybe better for a demo)
  - Eliza type "psychoanalysis"
- Video and/or music streaming site
- Travel site (book busses and flights)
- Messaging site with channels that can be subscribed to (like Telegram)
- Chatbot site (with fake chatbot, not real AI) for some topic (programming, travel, gaming, food, etc.)
- Dating site?





## Cross-Cutting Topics

- HTTP
  - HTTP protocol (request/response, types of requests, queries, headers, etc.)
  - Ports
  - Statelessness
  - Cookies
  - Sessions and session object (based on cookies)
  - HTTPS and everything related (SSL certificates, TLS, etc.)
- UX and UI Design
- C# Features
  - Lambdas
  - Linq
    - Can we just use SQL queries so we don't teach a proprietary query language? Maybe not.
  - Async/Await
- Unit testing and TDD
- **Ethics**
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- OOAnD and UML



## Term Project

- Don't allow projects that are too similar to the example: review sites, or sites with the same domain model structure.
- Add a requirement and grading criteria for UX (more than just navigation).
- Add a requirement for validation (if we cover that in this term)
- Make clear criteria for what should be tested by unit tests and min number of tests, 3?
- Make clear criteria for what can be copied from Stack Overflow--etc.
- Require repositories?
